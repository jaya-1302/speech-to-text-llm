# Speech to Text for Transcription Services

This project implements a Speech-to-Text (STT) pipeline designed for transcription services using audio input. It utilizes machine learning and natural language processing tools to convert spoken language into written text.

## Features

- Accepts audio input in `.wav` format.
- Uses pre-trained deep learning models for speech recognition.
- Outputs transcribed text for use in transcription services.
- Supports audio preprocessing (e.g., normalization, resampling).
- Displays audio waveform and spectrogram for visualization.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `speech_recognition`
- `pydub`
- `IPython.display` for audio playback
- `matplotlib` and `librosa` for visualization
- (Optional) `whisper` or `transformers` for advanced speech recognition

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository or download the notebook**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-transcription.git
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Example dependencies:
   ```text
   speechrecognition
   pydub
   librosa
   matplotlib
   ipython
   openai-whisper  # if using Whisper
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
   Open `project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. **Provide audio input**:
   Upload a `.wav` file and run the corresponding cells to process and transcribe the audio.

## Example Usage

- Load an audio file.
- Preprocess and visualize it.
- Run transcription model.
- View or save the transcribed output.

## Notes

- For best results, use clear, noise-free audio.
- Make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed if using `pydub` or Whisper.
